  |   The European Truck Racing Championship is one of the most             |
  |   spectacular and challenging motor racing competitions.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The driving difficulty and many unique race features have been        |
  |   faithfully reproduced with the KT Engine (WRC).                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In ETRC, like on real-life race tracks, you need to control the       |
  |   temperature of your brakes so they don't overheat. You must also      |
  |   consider the weight of the truck when cornering, monitor tyre wear    |
  |   and find the best tactics for overtaking.                             |
  |                                                                         |

  |   The most prestigious track in the United States ever since it was     |
  |   built in 1909, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the second oldest   |
  |   purpose-built motor racing circuit in the world. Its capacity, with   |
  |   room for over 400,000 spectators, makes it an ideal setting for       |
  |   legendary motorsport battles. In ETRC, Indianapolis is the ideal      |
  |   track for showing off the power of trucks.                            |
